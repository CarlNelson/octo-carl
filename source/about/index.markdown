I work at the intersection of design, context and action. I focus on creating experiences which reflect our interaction with the everyday world. With a background in phenomenology and pragmatism as a Philosophy student at Concordia University combined with a decade of teaching and performing as a professional dancer my work reflects the embodied human experience.

I learn from every project and draw upon many disciplines. That keeps me constantly curious about diving deeper. My current fascination is how design can guide behavior by encouraging better choices, facilitating the learning experience and shaping experiences that encourage deep real world connection.

I co-founded the award-winning email newsletter, [NOLAlicious](http://nolalicious.com/ "NOLAlicious"). I am not currently available for full-time or part-time work but may be interested in particular consulting work for the social good.

I live in San Francisco, CA where I am currently a Senior UI Designer at [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/ "Salesforce website"). I'm involved in the design community through [IxDA](http://ixda.org/ "Interaction Design Association"), [SDN](http://service-design-network.org "Service Design Network"), and local UX and designer meetups. I also teach about UX & Interaction design through [Skillshare](http://www.skillshare.com/profile/Carl-Nelson/5049813 "Carl on Skillshare").

I maintain a Tumblr as my digital notebobok of the web [here](http://astudyinmovement.com "A Study in Movement"). I am also a professional dance instructor and performer.
