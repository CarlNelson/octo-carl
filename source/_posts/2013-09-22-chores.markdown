Sometimes design is like doing chores around the house.

It’s sweeping and tidying.

Getting into the corners with a sponge.

Doing the dishes and folding the laundry.

It’s not always about the big choices. Like what your budget is for rent, where you live, or what color you paint your walls; even the choices about what you hang on the walls and what set of dishes you’ll purchase. Those things matter; they set the direction, but they don’t make the home.

The small tokens of effort, day in and day out, make the home. They tend the space. They show care and mindfulness.

Design needs direction; but more than ever, it needs mindfulness. It needs a sensitivity to consequences and normative functions, an awareness of culture and power, a sharing of responsibility and respect.

Do the chores. Find a sense of ease and solace in them. They rarely wow us in their completion, yet without them, our spaces end in shambles.
