I finally purchased a desk. After tormenting myself with the dreamy fields of vintage and high-end designer desks. I stumbled across a desk at Scandanavian Designs that was very nearly exactly what I was looking for. So much so that it parallelled some of the design decisions I made while sketching an ideal desk.

And so the first pieces of my creative workspace are coming together. The desk is the keystone. The rest layers atop of it.

It makes such a difference to have a workspace all your own. A place where you can feel free to leave work in progress scattered across the surface to come back to the next day. A place you can paste up crazy ideas. A place where hours whisk away as you begin researching a new project.
