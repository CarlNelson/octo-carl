It's been a long time since I had a consistent blog and I miss it often. Not for the having my voice out there but because by having a place to write I see the world differently. I take note of things I wouldn't necessarily have and I spend more time thinking about things. I want to get back to that place.

I recall reading an article somewhere about why people should blog and it was for that exact reason. Because it asks the writer to take note of things that they may not otherwise if they were not thinking of writing.

So, I'm rekindling my blog and for now putting my portfolio and other work offline while I think about how to reenvision them. I have some ideas, but they're going to take some serious work to make happen.

Lastly, I've been a huge proponent of Wordpress in the past. I think it's a great platform for so many people but it's just gotten so bloated and obnoxious to write in that I couldn't be bothered anymore. It's a full-on-publishing CMS, not a writing tool. I want to get back to writing. So, after wobbling around with a half-stab at [Nesta](http://nestacms.com "Nesta CMS"), I came upon [Octopress](http://octopress.org "Octopress"). Octopress is a lightweight, built for programmers, and gets me back into the command line and markdown. I also get to write SASS instead of CSS for styling and layout which I'm excited about getting deeper into.

Working in Sublime Text 2 to write and publishing by pushing a markdown file brings me back to the days where I wrote .php files and uploaded them to a folder and a php script continually displayed the latest in the list while appending that file to an archive list.
