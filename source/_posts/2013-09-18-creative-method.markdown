It's been 230 days (or so) since my last post and looking back at my [2013 Ahead](http://www.carlrnelson.com/blog/2013/01/30/2013-ahead/) I feel like I've done a decent job with some of the things on that list, minus the utter lack of writing that has occurred. And while the last seven months have been creative and good, they have felt scattered and unfocused in some ways. I've been lacking a system of organization even though I haven't missed the lack of one, until recently.

I started reading the book [Making Ideas Happen](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-ebook/dp/B003NX75W2/) by Scott Belsky, the founder of the Behance network and the creator of the Action Method, and started mulling over my lack of creative method. While not an egregious omission from my life, I imagine it keeps me from really tackling all of the things that need to get done in an effective and efficient manner.

With that in mind, I've taken it upon myself to piece my own Creative Method together using tools I like and some systems that work for other people.

##A creative method in four parts.

###Part One - Action Items
The central part of the Action Method is the Action Item: a discrete, actionable *(get it?)* piece of work that can be captured and checked off.

The Action Item is what drives work forward; if you can’t act on something, it’s just going to languish and never get done. It helps you to break work into discrete pieces that you can finish.

###Part Two - Evernote
I’ve used Evernote in the past to capture notes *(surprised, right?)*, images of white boarding sessions and sketches, and even to outline ideas for writing. However, I hadn’t though to use it as an organizational system until I read [Connected UX](http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux) and combined it with pieces of the Action Method from Making Ideas Happen.

It has everything that I need: tags, search, notes, photo capturing, memos. It’s a great place to store references, clip websites and articles, capture notes, create to-do lists, but most importantly to create a structured set of tags and searchable metadata around pieces of information.

Most to-do list applications, including the Action Method app, eventually fell by the wayside, replaced by sticky note to-do lists plastering the edges of my monitor, because they weren’t connected to the rest of the information I needed. Evernote gave me the perfect combination of unstructured data input with structured metadata that I could then query and act on.

###Part Three - Daily Planning
It’s easy to get into the office in the morning and get swept up in the bustling web of email, social networks, and meetings without even a nod to what you need to tackle that day. I’ve lost a lot of days to these kinds of mornings *(including today)* and they suck. They are hard to recover from without resetting your day somehow *(hitting the gym is usually my only good reset button)*.

Out of this planning wasteland were born my morning planning sessions. The first thing I do is sit down at my desk and go through my action items. I select a couple of high priority ones that will take dedicated time, often more involved design or analysis tasks. Also immediately tackling a few quick-to-knock-off action items, usually email followups or planning items. I’ll also quickly triage my email if I have time, create follow-up action items and get moving on my day.

###Part Four - Daily Retro
I took this idea from our agile practice at work but compressed it to a daily practice. It’s a quick look at what went well, what didn’t go well, and what I should think about changing. It’s bit of a reflective +/-/Δ moment where I try to understand how my day went.

I also use this time to add any end of day action items that I’ve jotted down on paper throughout the day that haven’t made it into Evernote yet.
